Various small programming projects. Mostly in Rust, and mostly PL/compilers related.

# crates/evaluation-strategies
# crates/json-parser
Motivating examples for exploring different approaches to performing recursion.
Specifically, I'm interested in the tradeoffs between storing call-frames on
the stack versus managing the call stack manually.

# crates/c-lexer
A lexer for the C programming language as specified by the C23 revision of the ISO standard.
Currently very unoptimized.
May be extended to preprocessor later if I have enough energy.
